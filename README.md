# The-Springfield-Capers

Writer's block? This can help writers generate new Simpsons episodes for the fans!

It uses the scripts of previous 27 seasons of "The Simpsons" for training, and uses a recurrent neural network. This is Project-3 of Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree.


This same network can be trained with any books, TV shows, etc. to generate absolutely new content for the same!
