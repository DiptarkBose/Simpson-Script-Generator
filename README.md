# The-Springfield-Capers

Writer's block? This can help writers generate new Simpsons episodes for the fans!

It uses the scripts of previous 27 seasons of "The Simpsons" for training, and uses a recurrent neural network. This is Project-3 of Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree.


This same network can be trained with any books, TV shows, etc. to generate absolutely new content for the same!

## Dependencies
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Tensorflow


Install all requirements using:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## The auto generated script looks as follows
``
moe_szyslak: ya know, i think it was a new test /?
homer_simpson:(beligerent) oh, no, that's what i do. i've have the money.(drains everyone, annoyed) just thinks i really drink.
kent_brockman: eh, i hate you a ride.
carl_carlson: i will like.
moe_szyslak:(chuckles) now i do don't are this out of the same... the only will say had the moolah-stealing barney.
lloyd:. _hooper: you can do worse.
moe_szyslak: don't where you, uh... uh, i've make a guy with generally romantic friends. and i rob his boy. you can use it.
moe_szyslak:(spanish) not no...(looks around, upset) oh hi, rummy...
moe_szyslak: oh... hardwood?... at five his night... a...
moe_szyslak:(sings) who never go?
moe_szyslak:(sings) well, homer's see...(to self) soon seems this
``

The script is a bit nonsensical as of now, but can be improved by more training, using bigger datasets, and tuning the hyperparams more carefully.

## Requirements
It trains on a huge dataset, and the use of a GPU is strictly advised. I have used FloydHub for training and validating my model.
